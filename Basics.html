  <h1>First 3 pieces </h1>
  <article class="piecei">
      <h2>KING</h2>
      <p>The king moves exactly one vacant square in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, or diagonally;<br>
         however, it cannot move to a square that is under attack by an opponent, nor can a player make a move with another piece if it will leave the king in check.<br>
        It also has a special move called castling, in which the king moves two squares towards one of its own rooks and in the same move, the rook jumps over the king to land on the square on the king's other side.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="piecei">
      <h2>QUEEN</h2>
      <p>The queen moves any number of vacant squares in any direction: forwards, backwards, left, right, or diagonally, in a straight line.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="piecei">
      <h2>ROOK</h2>
      <p>The rook moves any number of vacant squares forwards, backwards, left, or right in a straight line. It also takes part, along with the king, in a special move called castling.</p>
  </article>
  </article>

<article class="pieces">
  <h1>Second 3 pieces </h1>
  <article class="piece">
      <h2>BISHOP</h2>
      <p>The bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally in a straight line. Consequently, a bishop stays on squares of the same color throughout a game.<br> 
         The two bishops each player starts with move on squares of opposite colors.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="piece">
      <h2>KNIGHT</h2>
      <p>The knight moves on an extended diagonal from one corner of any 2×3 rectangle of squares to the furthest opposite corner.<br> 
         Consequently, the knight alternates its square color each time it moves.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="piece">
      <h2>PAWN</h2>
      <p>The pawn moves forward exactly one square, or optionally, two squares when on its starting square, toward the opponent's side of the board.<br>
         When there is an enemy piece one square diagonally ahead of a pawn, either left or right, then the pawn may capture that piece.<br>
        A pawn can perform a special type of capture of an enemy pawn called en passant. If the pawn reaches a square on the back rank of the opponent, it promotes to the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight</p>

            <h2>1 e4-e5</h2>
            <p class="title">Basic Open Game</p>
            <p>1 e4 has the following benefits:<br>
               1) It gains central control;<br>
               2) It allows the f1-bishop to develop, and gives the g1-knight another square;<br>
               3) Because of point '2', it brings White one move closer to kingside castling.<br>
               An obvious complement would be 2 d4, with potential development of every minor piece and excellent central control.<br>
               In order to frustrate 2 d4, as well as to get all of the above benefits for himself, Black plays 1...e5.

              <p class="title">Italian Game</p>
              <p>The development of White's bishop to c4 prepares castling, eyes the f7-pawn and hinders and early...d5. <br>
                 We would need a pretty compelling reason not to play such an obviously logical move and unfortunately such absention is justified<br>
                 by the fact that Black has a pretty easy route to equality in all variations.<br>
                 Attention has moved away from the Italian Game, with its more durable neighbour the Spanish Game<br>
                 proving a more promising route to an enduring edge for White.

              <h2>1 e4-e5 2 ♘c3</h2>
              <p class="title">Rare 2nd move</p>
              <p>The Vienna was initially conceived as aiming for an improved King's Gambit, but is considered rather toothless today.<br>
                2 ♗c4, the Bishop's Opening, is often used to transpose to the Italian Game, especailly since Black is denied the opportunity of<br>
                playing the Petroff. Here we look at some of White's attempts at keeping the game in independent channels.<br>
                2...♘f6 3 d3 ♘c6 (3...c6!? - intending...d5...is also very logical) 4 ♘c3 (4 f4 d5! is fine for Black) 4...♗b4 5 ♘f3 d5<br>
                6 exd5 ♘xd5 7 0-0 ♗xc3 8 bxc3 ♗g4 and I can't believe that Black is any worse here.
